The song is inspired by the chaotic nature of online activism - ranging from propaganda to virtue signaling, which contributes to the extreme social polarizations across the world. The lyrics explore personal experiences and vulnerable moments in AFKAP‚Äôs life that have made him toxic towards certain types of people. He concludes by stating that it‚Äôs extremely convenient to pull people down to feel better about ourselves, but the real conflict is being honest with our introspection. In a lawless world where truth is relative and ambiguous, the only way there can be a meaningful dialogue between opposing views is when people learn how to confront themselves before defying others.",
